# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge
Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge project! This repository brings together frontend, backend, and infrastructure to create a fully functional serverless application hosted on AWS. This challenge is more than just a resumeâ€”it's a demonstration of cloud computing and automation skills.

## What this Project Includes
### Frontend
The website is visually appealing and functional, hosted globally on AWS.
* __Files__:
  * _index.html_: The main webpage structure.
  * _script.js_: The logic powering the visitor counter.
  * _styles.css_: Custom styling for a cleaner look.
* __Hosting__: Delivered via S3 and ClouFront for fast, secure access.
